The Lionshield Coster is a merchant company based in the fortified city of Yartar.
The Lionshields' symbol is a blue lion painted on a wooden shield.

The merchant company ships finished goods, such as supplies of armor and weapons,
to small settlements and towns all throughout the northwestern region of Faer√ªn.
One such settlement is the newly settled frontier town of Phandalin near the
Triboar Trail and the Sword Mountains, however the outpost was hit hard by banditry.
