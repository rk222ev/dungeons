“Threats to home must be terminated without prejudice. Fight for the security and glory of your people!”


The Lords’ Alliance is a coalition of rulers from cities and towns across Faerûn
(primarily in the North), who collectively agree that some solidarity is needed to keep evil at bay.
The rulers of Waterdeep, Silverymoon, Neverwinter, and other free cities in the region dominate the Alliance,
and every lord in the Alliance works for the fate and fortune of his or her own settlement above all others.

** Beliefs

- If civilization is to survive, all must unite against the dark forces that threaten it.
- Glory comes from protecting one’s home and honoring its leaders.
- The best defense is a strong offense.

** Goals
To ensure the safety and prosperity of the cities and other settlements of Faerûn by forming a strong coalition
against the forces that threaten all, eliminate such threats by any means necessary whenever and wherever they
arise, and be champions of the people.
