“Threats to home must be terminated without prejudice. Fight for the security and glory of your people!”
</p>


<p>
The Lords’ Alliance is a coalition of rulers from cities and towns across Faerûn
(primarily in the North), who collectively agree that some solidarity is needed to keep evil at bay.
The rulers of Waterdeep, Silverymoon, Neverwinter, and other free cities in the region dominate the Alliance,
and every lord in the Alliance works for the fate and fortune of his or her own settlement above all others.
